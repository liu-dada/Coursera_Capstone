    "In this project we will try to find the ideal location for opening a new restaurant in San Antonio area. San Antonio is the 7th most populous city in the United States. The city is famous for its tourist attractions include the River Walk, the Tower of Americas, SeaWorld. Commercial entertainment like Six Flags and Morgan's Wonderland amusement parks. <br>\n",

    "We would like to choose a place where there is already has many residents or commercial facilities but not too many restaurants as competition.\n",

    "To start, we need data of zip code and their population in San Antonio, and we will also use data from Foursquare for information about venues like restaurants, hotels, and other stores. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we will explore the population and density distribution by zip code in San Antonio. We will exam the existing restaurants, how they distribute and how many people they serve currently. Then we will also explore the locations of restaurants and other places like gyms, hotels, etc in San Antonio. Finally we will build a regression model to identify the important factors that could affect the number of restaurants. <br>\n"
